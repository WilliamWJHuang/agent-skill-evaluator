## Why This Exists

There are **1,000+ agent skills** on GitHub. Most have no quality signal beyond stars and recency. Before installing a skill into your agent:

- Is it **structurally sound**? (valid SKILL.md, proper metadata)
- Is it **safe**? (no prompt injection, credential harvesting, data exfiltration)
- Is it **high quality**? (decision trees, guardrails, edge cases)
- Is it **domain-correct**? (does it recommend the right statistical test? the right causal method?)
- Is it **maintained**? (recent updates, tests, documentation)

`skill-evaluator` answers all five questions with a single command.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
cd skill-evaluator
pip install -e .

# Evaluate a local skill
skill-eval ../skills/experiment-designer/

# Evaluate with Markdown output (for CI/READMEs)
skill-eval ../skills/stats-reviewer/ --format md

# Evaluate with JSON output (for pipelines)
skill-eval ../skills/causal-inference-advisor/ --format json

# Force a specific domain for correctness checking
skill-eval ./some-skill/ --domain statistics

# CI mode: fail if score is below threshold
skill-eval ./some-skill/ --fail-below 70
```

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What It Checks |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Structure** | 15% | YAML frontmatter, required fields, section organization |
| **Security** | 20% | Shell injection, credential exfil, prompt injection, obfuscation |
| **Quality** | 15% | Decision trees, guardrails, edge cases, escape hatches, code templates |
| **Domain Correctness** | 25% | Rule-based verification of domain-specific methodology |
| **Maintenance** | 15% | File freshness, docs, tests, CI config, git signals |

### Grading Scale

| Grade | Score Range | Meaning |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| A+ | 95–100 | Exceptional — install with confidence |
| A | 90–94 | Excellent — high quality, well-maintained |
| B+ | 80–84 | Good — solid skill with some gaps |
| B | 75–79 | Above average — usable but review findings |
| C+ | 65–69 | Fair — significant gaps, use with caution |
| D | 40–49 | Very poor — not recommended |
| F | 0–39 | Failing — critical issues, do not install |

## Domain Correctness Rules

The **novel differentiator**. Unlike security/structure checks that any tool can do, domain correctness verifies the *guidance itself* is correct.

### Built-in Domains

| Domain | Rules | Checks |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Statistics** | 8 | Normality assumptions, effect sizes, multiple comparisons, power analysis, seed sensitivity |
| **Causal Inference** | 8 | Identification strategies, parallel trends, IV assumptions, RDD bandwidth, matching balance |
| **Data Science** | 5 | Data leakage, missing data mechanisms, cross-validation, metric selection, outlier handling |

### Adding Custom Domains

Create a YAML file in `skill_evaluator/domains/`:

```yaml
domain: my-domain
version: "1.0.0"
rules:
  - name: my-rule
    description: "What this rule checks"
    applicability_patterns:
      - "pattern that makes this rule relevant"
    required_patterns:
      - "pattern that SHOULD be present"
    antipatterns:
      - "pattern that SHOULD NOT be present"
    failure_severity: suspicious  # or "incorrect"
    failure_message: "What went wrong"
    success_message: "What went right"
```

We ship with Statistics, Causal Inference, and Data Science domains, but this is meant to be extensible. If you have domain expertise in another area (e.g., epidemiology, finance, NLP evaluation, survey design) and want to contribute a rule set, open a PR with your YAML file and we'll review it. The more domains covered, the more useful this tool becomes for everyone.

## CI Integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Evaluate Skills
  run: |
    pip install -e ./skill-evaluator
    skill-eval ./skills/my-skill/ --fail-below 70 --format json
```

### As a Pre-commit Hook

```bash
skill-eval ./skills/ --fail-below 60
```

---

## Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run against your own skills
skill-eval ../skills/experiment-designer/
skill-eval ../skills/stats-reviewer/
```

## How scoring works

Each dimension (Structure, Security, Quality, Domain Correctness, Maintenance) produces a 0-100 score. These are combined into a weighted composite.

A few things worth knowing about the scoring:

**Security is a gate, not just a weight.** If the security analyzer finds critical risks (prompt injection, credential harvesting, destructive shell commands), the overall score is hard-capped regardless of how well the skill scores on other dimensions. A skill with a prompt injection vulnerability gets an F even if the content is otherwise excellent.

**Scores are normalized by applicable checks.** Quality and maintenance scores are computed as the ratio of passed checks to applicable checks. A concise, well-written skill won't score lower than a verbose one just because it has fewer regex matches. Each check that fires gets equal vote.

**Structural penalties are weighted by severity.** Missing your SKILL.md entirely costs more than missing a recommended field. The penalty for each finding reflects how much it actually impacts usability.

**What the scores don't tell you.** The current system is a static linter — it checks patterns in text. It can't tell you whether the skill actually makes an agent perform better, or whether the domain guidance is semantically correct beyond keyword matching. Those are harder problems (see below).

---

## Future research

These are directions we'd like to explore. Contributions welcome.

**Empirical weight calibration.** The dimension weights (Security 20%, Domain 25%, etc.) are based on judgment, not data. The right approach is to score a labeled corpus of known-good vs. known-bad skills and use the results to find weights that best predict the label. If you have a labeled skill corpus or want to help build one, open an issue.

**Semantic domain checks.** The domain correctness analyzer currently uses regex patterns — it checks whether certain keywords appear, not whether the guidance is actually correct. Replacing this with embedding-based or lightweight LLM checks (e.g., "does this skill enforce power analysis, or just mention it?") would substantially improve accuracy.

**Behavioral evaluation.** The ultimate test of a skill is: does an agent using it produce better outputs? A test harness with known-correct answers (e.g., "given this dataset, should the agent refuse to run the test?") would let us score skills by downstream impact rather than surface patterns. This is the direction taken by SkillsBench-style evaluations and would make this tool a performance predictor, not just a linter.
